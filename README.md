# Sensei Strategy

## Overview

The Sensei Strategy is a sophisticated DeFi yield farming strategy implemented on the Starknet blockchain. It leverages multiple lending protocols to maximize returns through a recursive borrowing and lending process.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Deposit**: Users deposit USDC into the strategy.

2. **Recursive Loop**: The strategy then performs the following steps multiple times:
   a. Supply USDC to zkLend
   b. Borrow ETH from zkLend
   c. Deposit ETH to Nostra
   d. Borrow USDC from Nostra

3. **Reward Compounding**: The strategy can compound rewards (STRK tokens) by selling them for USDC and reinvesting.

## Key Features

- Utilizes both zkLend and Nostra protocols
- Implements a 4x leverage strategy
- Automatic reward compounding

## Risks

While the Sensei Strategy aims to maximize yields, it comes with several inherent risks:

1. **Smart Contract Risk**: The strategy relies on multiple smart contracts (Sensei, zkLend, Nostra). Any bugs or vulnerabilities in these contracts could lead to loss of funds.

2. **Protocol Risk**: If either zkLend or Nostra face issues or get compromised, it could affect the strategy's performance or user funds.

3. **Liquidation Risk**: The strategy uses borrowed funds, which creates a risk of liquidation if asset prices move unfavorably. This won't be a major issue as it stated that original investments are safe.

4. **Market Risk**: Significant price fluctuations between USDC and ETH could impact the strategy's performance and potentially lead to losses.

5. **Impermanent Loss**: The strategy involves providing liquidity, which can lead to impermanent loss if asset prices diverge significantly.

7. **Complexity Risk**: The recursive nature of the strategy increases its complexity, potentially making it harder to predict all possible outcomes or edge cases.

8. **Gas Costs**: High gas costs on Starknet could eat into profits, especially for smaller deposits.

9. **Reward Token Risk**: The value of STRK tokens used for rewards could decrease, affecting the profitability of the compounding feature.

10. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes in regulations around DeFi or any of the involved protocols could impact the strategy's viability.
